APP: <https://nuuuwan.github.io/lk_locator>

A simple, vibe-coded map app to figure out where in Sri Lanka you are.

Just drag anywhere on the map to instantly see the corresponding:
• Province
• District
• Divisional Secretariat Division (DSD)
• Grama Niladhari Division (GND)
• Electoral District
• Polling Division (PD)
• Local Authority

Why not use Google Maps? Because it does not tell you which DSD, GND, PD, or local authority your location belongs to.
